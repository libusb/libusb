2012-09-20: v1.0.13
* [MAJOR] Fix a typo in the API with struct libusb_config_descriptor where
  MaxPower was used instead of bMaxPower, as defined in the specs. If your 
  application was accessing the MaxPower attribute, and you need to maintain
  compatibility with libusb or older versions, see APPENDIX A below.
* Fix broken support for the 0.1 -> 1.0 libusb-compat layer
* Fix unwanted cancellation of pending timeouts as well as major timeout related bugs
* Fix handling of HID and composite devices on Windows
* Introduce LIBUSBX_API_VERSION macro
* Add Cypress FX/FX2 firmware upload sample, based fxload from
  http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net
* Add libusb0 (libusb-win32) and libusbK driver support on Windows. Note that while
  the drivers allow it, isochronous transfers are not supported yet in libusbx. Also
  not supported yet is the use of libusb-win32 filter drivers on composite interfaces
* Add support for the new get_capabilities ioctl on Linux and avoid unnecessary
  splitting of bulk transfers
* Improve support for newer Intel and Renesas USB 3.0 controllers on Windows
* Harmonize the device number for root hubs accross platforms
* Other bug fixes and improvements

2012-06-15: v1.0.12
* Fix a potential major regression with pthread on Linux
* Fix missing thread ID from debug log output on cygwin
* Fix possible crash when using longjmp and MinGW's gcc 4.6
* Add topology calls: libusb_get_port_number(), libusb_get_parent() & libusb_get_port_path()
* Add toggleable debug, using libusb_set_debug() or the LIBUSB_DEBUG environment variable
* Define log levels in libusb.h and set timestamp origin to first libusb_init() call
* All logging is now sent to to stderr (info was sent to stdout previously)
* Update log messages severity and avoid polluting log output on OS-X
* Add HID driver support on Windows
* Enable interchangeability of MSVC and MinGW DLLs
* Additional bug fixes and improvements

2012-05-08: v1.0.11
* Revert removal of critical Windows event handling that was introduced in 1.0.10
* Fix a possible deadlock in Windows when submitting transfers
* Add timestamped logging
* Add NetBSD support (experimental) and BSD libusb_get_device_speed() data
* Add bootstrap.sh alongside autogen.sh (bootstrap.sh doesn't invoke configure)
* Search for device nodes in /dev for Android support
* Other bug fixes

2012-04-17: v1.0.10

APPENDIX A - How to maintain code compatibility with versions of libusb and
libusbx that use MaxPower:

If you must to maintain compatibility with versions of the library that aren't
using the bMaxPower attribute in struct libusb_config_descriptor, the 
recommended way is to use the new LIBUSBX_API_VERSION macro with an #ifdef.
For instance, if your code was written as follows:

  if (dev->config[0].MaxPower < 250)

Then you should modify it to have:

#if defined(LIBUSBX_API_VERSION) && (LIBUSBX_API_VERSION >= 0x01000100)
  if (dev->config[0].bMaxPower < 250)
#else
  if (dev->config[0].MaxPower < 250)
#endif
