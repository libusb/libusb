for 1.0
=======
cancellation race concerns - better tracking of kernel feedback?
isochronous endpoint I/O
thread safety
error codes
fixme review
review functionality missing over 0.1
endianness of control setup, issues when resubmitting transfers
interpreting transfer flags after callback returns is not safe
rename poll to handle_events
make libusb_get_pollfds return const?
doxygen warnings
bmRequestType
make descriptor things const?

1.0 API style/naming points to reconsider
=========================================
typedef _cb or _cb_fn or _cb_t?
typedef as-is or pointers? libusb_dev_t rather than libusb_dev *?

for 1.1 or future
==================
optional timerfd support (runtime detection)
notifications of hotplugged/unplugged devices
use poll() rather than select()?
offer API to create/destroy handle_events thread
