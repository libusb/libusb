o Visual Studio:
  - Open existing or create a new project for your application
  - Copy libusb.h, from the include\libusbx-1.0\ directory, into your project and
    make sure that the location where the file reside appears in the 'Additional
    Include Directories' section (Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General).
  - Copy the relevant .lib file from ARMV4I, MIPSII, MIPSII_FP, MIPSIV, MIPSIV_FP,
    SH4 or x86 and add 'libusb-1.0.lib' to  your 'Additional Dependencies'
    (Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input). Also make sure that the
    directory where libusb-1.0.lib resides is added to 'Additional Library
    Directories' (Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General)
  - If you use the static version of the libusbx library, make sure that
    'Runtime Library' is set to 'Multi-threaded DLL (/MD)' (Configuration
    Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation).
    NB: If your application requires /MT (Multi-threaded/libCMT), you need to
    recompile a static libusbx 1.0 library from source.
  - Compile and run your application. If you use the DLL version of libusb-1.0,
    remember that you need to have a copy of the DLL either in the runtime
    directory or in system32
