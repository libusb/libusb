/*
 * jaemon.h - C-side Jaeman definitions
 *
 * Jaemon is a library that allows to load and run what used to be an executable
 * within the Java process.
 *
 * Motivations.
 *
 * With release of Android 5.0 security measures where significantly increased.
 * A process, started by an Android app does not inherit all app's permissions,
 * file descriptors, etc. Therefore a process that could run normally on
 * Android 4.0 may fail due to insufficient permissions.
 * Such executable can be rebuilt as a shared library and run by Jaemon.
 * The original code needs no modifications. Only the build has to be altered,
 * as the following:
 *  1. this file has to be included with --include jaemon.h to intercept
 *     exit, abort and fork calls
 *  2. linker should be instructed to produce shared library
 *  3. Sources should be compiled with -fPIC and linked with -fPIE flags
